# ECO-SA: Optimized Disinformation Containment

**This repository contains the implementation of the ECO-SA strategy, which is the core focus of the article "Identifying Critical Nodes for Optimal Disinformation Containment in Echo Chambers" (currently under submission).**

## üí° Strategy Overview (ECO-SA)

**ECO-SA** is an **optimized containment strategy** designed to mitigate the spread of disinformation within **Echo Chambers**.

The strategy utilizes the **Simulated Annealing (SA)** heuristic to efficiently identify and select **critical nodes** in a graph. The goal is that, by "blocking" these identified nodes, the overall information dissemination is significantly reduced, maximizing containment effectiveness.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Simulations and Data

The effectiveness of ECO-SA was validated through extensive simulations and comparative analyses.

* **Dissemination Model:** We employed the **Profile information diffusion model** [1].
* **Data:** Testing was conducted using the **Morini dataset** [2], specifically its 15 samples based on three distinct sociopolitical issues, to simulate realistic echo chamber scenarios.
* **Evaluations:**
    * **Intramethodological Evaluation:** A comprehensive set de experiments that simulate the propagation of information within the echo chambers using different network parameters and configuration scenarios (e.g., source nodes, user resistance profiles) to assess the internal performance of ECO-SA.
    * **Intermethodological Evaluation:** Comparative experiments to test the mitigating performance of ECO-SA against traditional node and edge blocking approaches under the same initial conditions.

## üìÅ Repository Content

The repository is structured as follows:

* **`src` folder:** Contains the **ECO-SA notebook codes**, along with the intra-methodological and inter-methodological evaluation codes used for comparison.
* **`img` folder:** Includes all the **output values** (e.g., plots, charts, figures) generated by the simulations.
* **`Critical Nodes` folder:** Includes all the sets of our **critical nodes** selected by ECO-SA and the critical node sets from the other proposals used in the comparison.
